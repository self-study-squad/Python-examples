# Write a Python program to print the first n Lucky Numbers. 
# Lucky numbers are defined via a sieve as follows.
# Begin with a list of integers starting with 1 :
# 1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6,7,8,9,10,11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,....
# Now eliminate every second number :
# 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, ...
# The second remaining number is 3, so remove every 3rd number:
# 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 19, 21, 25, ...
# The next remaining number is 7, so remove every 7th number:
# 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 21, 25, ...
# Next, remove every 9th number and so on. 
# Finally, the resulting sequence is the lucky numbers.
