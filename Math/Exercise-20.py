# Write a Python program to calculate magic square.
# A magic square is an arrangement of distinct numbers (i.e., each number is used once),
# usually integers, in a square grid, where the numbers in each row, and in each column,
# and the numbers in the main and secondary diagonals, all add up to the same number,
# called the "magic constant." A magic square has the same number of rows as it has columns,
# and in conventional math notation, "n" stands for the number of rows (and columns) it has.
# Thus, a magic square always contains n2 numbers, and its size (the number of rows 
# [and columns] it has) is described as being "of order n".

    sum_list.extend([sum (lines) for lines in my_matrix])   

    #Vertical Part:
    for col in range(iSize):
        sum_list.append(sum(row[col] for row in my_matrix))

        result2 +=my_matrix[i][i]
    sum_list.append(result2)
