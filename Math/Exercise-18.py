# Write a Python program to computing square roots using the Babylonian method.
# Perhaps the first algorithm used for approximating sqrt S is known as the Babylonian
# method, named after the Babylonians, or "Hero's method", named after the 
# first-century Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria who gave the first explicit
# description of the method. It can be derived from (but predates by 16 centuries) 
# Newton's method. The basic idea is that if x is an overestimate to the square 
# root of a non-negative real number S then S / x will be an underestimate and 
# so the average of these two numbers may reasonably be expected to provide 
# a better approximation.
